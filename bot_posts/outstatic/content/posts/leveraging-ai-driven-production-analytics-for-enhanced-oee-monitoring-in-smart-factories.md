## Perspective: AI Analytics in OEE Monitoring

In the era of **Industry 4.0** and **smart manufacturing**, the use of **AI-based analytics** is becoming a key element in optimizing production processes. **OEE** (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) is one of the most important indicators that allows for the assessment of machine and production process efficiency. By leveraging modern technologies such as **IoT** and **machine learning**, companies can gain a competitive edge through more precise monitoring and data analysis.

## What is OEE?
**OEE** is a metric that measures the effectiveness of machine utilization in production. It consists of three main components:
- **Availability**: The time during which a machine is available for production compared to the planned time.
- **Performance**: The production rate compared to the theoretical rate.
- **Quality**: The proportion of products meeting quality standards to the total production.

## How Does AI Impact OEE Monitoring?
The application of **AI** in OEE monitoring allows for:
- **Real-time data collection**: By using IoT sensors, data on machine performance is collected in real-time, enabling quick responses to issues.
- **Failure prediction**: **Machine learning** algorithms analyze historical data, allowing for the prediction of potential machine failures and minimizing downtime.
- **Process optimization**: Data analysis helps identify bottlenecks in the production process and optimize work schedules.

## Example of ROI Calculations from AI Analytics Implementation
To illustrate the benefits of implementing AI-based analytics in the context of OEE monitoring, let's consider a hypothetical example:

1. **Availability**: A production facility has a planned working time of 800 hours per month. Over the last month, the machine was unavailable for 80 hours, resulting in an availability of 90%.
2. **Performance**: The theoretical production rate is 1000 units per hour, but the actual rate is 800 units per hour, resulting in a performance of 80%.
3. **Quality**: Out of 20,000 produced units, 1,000 were defective, resulting in a quality rate of 95%.

We calculate OEE:

\[ OEE = \text{Availability} \times \text{Performance} \times \text{Quality} \]
\[ OEE = 0.90 \times 0.80 \times 0.95 = 0.684 \]

This means that the machine's efficiency is 68.4%. Implementing an AI analytics system can improve each of these metrics:
- **Availability** increases by 5% due to failure prediction.
- **Performance** increases by 10% due to process optimization.
- **Quality** increases by 3% due to better quality control.

After implementation:
\[ OEE = 0.95 \times 0.90 \times 0.98 = 0.836 \]

This represents an OEE increase of 15.6%. Assuming the production facility generates revenues of 100,000 PLN per month, the increase in OEE could translate into additional revenue:
- **Additional profit** = 100,000 PLN * 15.6% = 15,600 PLN per month.
