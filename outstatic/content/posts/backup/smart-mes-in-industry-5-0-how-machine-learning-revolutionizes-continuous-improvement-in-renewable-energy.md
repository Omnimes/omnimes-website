## **ROI: up to 15% efficiency gains and 10–20% better energy storage performance – this is the real power of AI in modern energy.**

In the era of **Industry 5.0**, where technology merges with a human-centric approach, the renewable energy sector is growing at an unprecedented pace – with **18.6 GW** of additional solar capacity installed in the first nine months of 2024.\
**Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)** enhanced with **machine learning** are becoming a cornerstone of this transformation, delivering both business and technical benefits.

### MES Market – The Numbers

- Global MES market: **$15–17B (2024)** → forecasted **$27–42B (2030–2032)**

- CAGR: **9.4–14.1%**

- **51% of revenues** come from services

- Asia-Pacific leads with **29.7% share**, driven by initiatives like *Made in China 2025*

### Industry 5.0 vs Industry 4.0

- **Industry 4.0** = automation & digitalization

- **Industry 5.0** = human-centric, sustainable, resilient manufacturing + intuitive human–machine collaboration

### Machine Learning in MES – Real Benefits

**Predictive maintenance & optimization**

- +15% network efficiency

- +10–20% energy storage improvement

- **SVR**: MSE 2.002 (PV), 3.059 (wind)

- **Random Forest**: –8.5% prediction error

- **ROI**: 18–24 months

**Smart forecasting & grid management**

- Real-time balancing of supply & demand

- Grid stability optimization

- Intelligent demand response

### MES with ML – System Architecture

- **Data layer**: IoT sensors, SCADA, PLCs, edge computing

- **ML layer**: LSTM, Random Forest, SVM, ARIMA, anomaly detection

- **Interface layer**: intuitive HMIs, AR for operators, collaborative robots (cobots)

**Implementation phases**:

1. Assessment & planning (2–4 months)

2. Pilot (4–6 months)

3. Full rollout (6–12 months)

### Case Studies

**Smart Solar Farm, Spain (500 MW):**

- +12% production

- –25% downtime

- ROI: 16 months

**Offshore Wind Farm, North Sea (150 turbines):**

- –30% unplanned downtime

- €2.3M annual savings

- +18% availability factor

### Challenges & Barriers

- **Technical**: legacy integration, protocol standardization, real-time data, cybersecurity

- **Organizational**: change management, workforce upskilling, high CAPEX vs. proven ROI

### The Future – Trends

- Quantum computing for energy simulation

- Green IT & circular economy

- Blockchain for energy trading

- By 2030: PV & wind &gt;50% of global electricity

### Bottom Line

- +15% efficiency gains

- ROI: 18–24 months

- Reduced prediction errors

**Industry 5.0 is not about *if* but *when* and *how fast*.**\
The future of energy is human + machine working together for a sustainable and profitable tomorrow. **The time to act is now.**
