# Introduction

In the age of digitization, **MES systems** (Manufacturing Execution Systems) are becoming a key tool not only in production management but also in the context of **cybersecurity**. In the face of increasing threats to data and operational systems, companies must find ways to **optimize costs** associated with protection against cyberattacks. In this article, we will present strategies that allow leveraging MES systems to gain a competitive advantage through effective cost management in the area of cybersecurity.

# Why is MES Critical in Cybersecurity?

MES systems are designed to monitor and manage production processes in real-time. By integrating with other systems such as IoT and Big Data, MES can provide valuable insights into the security status within the organization. Here are a few reasons why it is worth considering the use of MES in the context of cybersecurity:

- **Increased Visibility**: MES allows for real-time monitoring of processes, making it easier to identify potential threats.
- **Rapid Response**: Through process automation, MES systems enable quick responses to security incidents.
- **Data Management**: MES collects and analyzes data, allowing for better risk management.

# Cost Optimization Strategies in Cybersecurity

To effectively utilize MES systems for cost optimization in the area of cybersecurity, it is advisable to implement several key strategies:

## 1. Risk Analysis and Prioritization

The first step is to conduct a thorough risk analysis. Identifying areas that are most vulnerable to attacks allows for concentrating resources on the most critical elements of the system. To this end, it is worth:

- Conducting a security audit.
- Identifying critical resources and data.
- Establishing security priorities.

## 2. Utilizing Automation

MES systems offer automation capabilities that can reduce costs associated with monitoring and managing security. Automation allows for:

- Reducing human error.
- Increasing operational efficiency.
- Lowering costs related to hiring specialists.

## 3. Employee Training

Investing in employee training is crucial for enhancing the security level within the organization. Employees should be aware of threats and know the procedures for responding to incidents. Effective training can:

- Reduce the risk of phishing attacks.
- Increase team engagement in security issues.
- Decrease costs associated with mistakes resulting from ignorance.

## 4. Collaboration with Suppliers

Collaborating with external security service providers can bring benefits in the form of access to the latest technologies and expert knowledge. It is worth considering:

- Outsourcing some security-related functions.
- Partnering with companies specializing in cybersecurity.
- Participating in certification programs.

## 5. Utilizing the OmniMES System

In the context of cost optimization in cybersecurity, it is worth paying attention to the **OmniMES** system, which enables integrated management of production processes and data security. With its features, organizations can effectively monitor and manage risk, contributing to reduced costs associated with cyberattacks.

# Summary

Cost optimization in cybersecurity is crucial for gaining a competitive advantage. Utilizing MES systems, including OmniMES, in conjunction with appropriate strategies allows for effective risk management and cost reduction. It is advisable to invest in automation, training, and collaboration with experts to secure your resources and data.
