In modern manufacturing plants, every second of machine operation matters. Even short, seemingly insignificant interruptions – so-called micro-downtimes – can generate substantial losses on a production line. Research (Aberdeen Research) shows that unplanned downtime can cost manufacturing companies from hundreds to even thousands of dollars per minute. This is one of the reasons why more and more enterprises implement MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems). They support maintenance, enable real-time machine performance analysis, and help minimize the negative impact of micro-downtimes.

## Micro-downtimes – an invisible large-scale problem

Micro-downtimes are short, recurring disturbances in machine operation. They occur, for example, when material jams in a feeder, an operator waits for a device restart, or a sensor reports an error that quickly disappears. A single event lasts only a few seconds and seems negligible. However, over a month or a year, they can account for more than ten percent of lost efficiency. This is a real financial loss that companies often overlook.

## Where to start minimizing downtime?

***Diagnosis of the situation***\
The first step is a thorough diagnosis. Many companies are unaware of the scale of micro-downtimes because they are not visible in standard reports. That is why it is crucial to implement a system that automatically records and analyzes even the shortest stoppages. Only then can real losses be estimated, and corrective actions planned.

***Mapping critical points***\
The next step is identifying so-called critical points – workstations where stoppages occur most often or which act as bottlenecks. Downtime at these points stops the entire production line, so they should be the first focus for monitoring and optimization.

***Obtaining data from machines***\
Reliable production data is the foundation of effective monitoring. It can come from various sources – PLC controllers, sensors, or edge devices. The key is for the data to be consistent and easily accessible to higher-level systems. Otherwise, MES cannot be treated as a trustworthy source of information.

A good example of a communication protocol ensuring data integrity is [**Sparkplug B**](https://www.omnimes.com/en/blog/utilization-of-smart-manufacturing-and-failure-prediction-in-mes-with-sparkplug-b-protocol). Based on MQTT, it enables real-time data transfer, supports security, and allows easy system scalability.

## MES as a tool to control and reduce downtime

Implementing an MES provides full visibility of production processes. In practice, this means:

- real-time machine monitoring – operators and managers immediately see when a machine is underperforming,

- automatic event recording – every stoppage, even a short one, is logged,

- root cause analysis – reports show recurring problem sources,

- proactive measures – predictive maintenance can be applied to prevent major breakdowns.

## OmniMES – MES supporting maintenance

One solution dedicated to minimizing downtimes is **OmniMES**. The system offers real-time production status monitoring via a browser, reporting of micro-downtime causes, and intuitive analytical tools. Thanks to its integration with maintenance, issues can be addressed quickly, while online access enables use on any device – without additional software installation.

## Business benefits of reducing micro-downtimes

***Improved production efficiency***\
Greater machine availability means more products manufactured in the same time frame – an efficiency increase without investing in new lines. Material waste and energy consumption are also reduced. Production planning becomes more accurate, enabling better lead time forecasts and faster response to customer needs.

***Faster problem response***\
MES shortens the diagnostic process. Traditionally, machine logs had to be analyzed and discussed with operators. With MES, every stoppage is automatically linked to a machine or process, allowing immediate action and reducing losses.

***Improved product quality***\
Micro-downtimes increase the risk of errors – a machine restart may cause quality deviations or defects. Minimizing these interruptions means more stable processes, fewer rejects and complaints, and a stronger reputation for consistent, high quality.

## Conclusion

Micro-downtimes are a silent but costly issue in production. They can reduce efficiency by more than ten percent annually, generating substantial financial losses. MES systems effectively limit these losses – thanks to real-time monitoring, root cause analysis, and proactive diagnostics.

Solutions such as **OmniMES** show that minimizing micro-downtimes is not only a matter of technology but also of production management strategy. It is an investment that pays off quickly – financially, in quality, and organizationally.
