## Introduction

In the era of Industry 5.0, production efficiency increasingly depends on an enterprise’s ability to process and use data in real time. Integrating Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) with Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) is now a key pillar of digital transformation in industrial plants. Solutions such as Multiprojekt’s **Omnimes** enable companies to fully realize the potential of this integration.

## The Role of PLCs in Modern Industrial IT Systems

PLCs serve as primary data collection nodes within the IT architecture of modern manufacturing facilities. Contemporary controllers, equipped with communication protocols such as **OPC UA**, **Modbus TCP**, and **EtherNet/IP**, enable:

**Real-time monitoring of technological parameters:**

- Machine performance and utilization (**OEE – Overall Equipment Effectiveness**)

- Process parameters (temperature, pressure, flow)

- Energy and utilities consumption

- Actual production cycle times

- Equipment alarms and diagnostic states

**Production data analytics:**\
Data gathered by PLCs is the foundation for analytics used in MES-class systems. Industry research indicates that companies implementing comprehensive PLC–MES solutions typically achieve:

- 20–30% reduction in unplanned downtime

- 15–25% increase in OEE

- 10–20% reduction in changeover times

- 8–15% improvement in product quality

## Omnimes as an Integration Platform

Multiprojekt’s **Omnimes** is a comprehensive MES platform designed for integration with diverse industrial automation systems. Key system capabilities include:

**IT architecture:**

- Integration modules supporting standard industrial communication protocols

- Real-time database with buffering and redundancy mechanisms

- APIs for integration with ERP systems and external applications

- Scalable architecture tailored to organizations of different sizes

**Manufacturing functionality:**

- Dynamic production planning and scheduling

- Product genealogy tracking (**traceability**)

- Quality management with **SPC** (Statistical Process Control) modules

- Predictive maintenance management

## Practical IT-Side Benefits of Integration

1. **Decision-process automation**\
   Integrating PLCs with MES enables AI-based algorithms for production schedule optimization. Omnimes applies machine learning to:

- Predict order lead times based on historical data

- Optimize production sequences under resource constraints

- Automatically recognize patterns leading to downtime

1. **Big Data analytics in manufacturing**\
   Modern lines generate terabytes of data daily. Omnimes processes this using:

- **Stream processing** algorithms for real-time analysis

- Data warehouses for historical analytics and reporting

- Analytical dashboards visualizing production KPIs

1. **Integration with the enterprise IT ecosystem**\
   The system supports standard data exchange mechanisms, such as:

- **REST APIs** for ERP integration (SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics)

- **MQTT** for IoT communication

- **Web Services** for external applications

- **Database connectors** for analytics platforms (Power BI, Tableau)

## Case Study – Automotive Deployment

A manufacturer in the automotive sector deployed Omnimes integrated with **45 PLCs** across three production lines. Results after 12 months:

**Technical indicators:**

- OEE increased from **72% to 89%**

- Unplanned downtime reduced by **35%**

- Average changeover time cut from **45 to 28 minutes**

**Economic benefits:**

- Throughput increased by **22%**

- Maintenance costs reduced by **18%**

- **ROI** achieved in the **14th month** after go-live

## Future Technologies in PLC–MES Integration

**Edge computing**\
Omnimes leverages edge computing by placing analytical modules directly at the PLC level. This enables:

- Lower data-processing latency

- Reduced industrial network load

- Higher system reliability

**Artificial intelligence in scheduling**\
AI algorithms in Omnimes analyze:

- Historical patterns of downtime and failures

- Optimal changeover sequences

- Forecasts of raw material and component demand

- Product quality predictions based on process parameters

**Industrial cybersecurity**\
The system safeguards industrial data through:

- Encrypted communications (**TLS 1.3**)

- Industrial network segmentation

- Real-time security monitoring

- Compliance with **IEC 62443**
