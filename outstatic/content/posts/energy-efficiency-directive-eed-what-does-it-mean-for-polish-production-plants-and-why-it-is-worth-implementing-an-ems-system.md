## What is the new EED (Directive (EU) 2023/1791)?

The revised **Energy Efficiency Directive (EED)** – **Directive (EU) 2023/1791** – sets out the framework and obligations designed to help the European Union achieve ambitious energy-saving targets.\
Among other things, the EED aims to **reduce final energy consumption in the EU by 11.7% by 2030** compared to reference projections.\
It replaces the previous **Directive 2012/27/EU** and entered into force on **10 October 2023**.\
Member States are required to transpose its key provisions into national law – the **deadline for transposition was 11 October 2025**.

## Key obligations for enterprises (especially manufacturing)

### 1) The Directive requires either an Energy Management System (EMS) or an energy audit – depending on energy consumption

Article 11 of the EED defines the energy-consumption thresholds that determine the obligations:

- **Companies consuming &gt;85 TJ/year (approx. 23.6 GWh average over 3 years)** – must implement an Energy Management System certified in accordance with **ISO 50001**.\
  The system must be implemented **no later than 11 October 2027**.

- **Companies consuming &gt;10 TJ/year (approx. 2.78 GWh average over 3 years)** – must perform an **energy audit every 4 years**, unless they have an EMS in place (in which case an external audit is not required).\
  The company must bear the cost of the audit.

### 2) National audit requirement every 4 years

Regardless of the EED, large enterprises in Poland are required to carry out an **energy audit every four years**.\
Failure to do so may result in financial penalties.\
A certified **EMS compliant with ISO 50001 or EMAS** exempts the company from the recurring audit, provided that an internal audit is performed within the system.

## Why implement an EMS (ISO 50001)?

Implementing an EMS not only eliminates the need for recurring audits but also enables **optimization of energy and utility costs**.\
EMS systems provide the essential data that drive efficiency in modern industry.

1. **Regulatory compliance and peace of mind**\
   For entities consuming &gt;10 TJ/year, an ISO 50001-certified EMS replaces the recurring audit requirement.

2. **Avoided audit costs**\
   Typical audit costs for multi-site manufacturing companies can reach **PLN 30,000–40,000 per audit**.

3. **Tangible energy savings**\
   An EMS enables real-time monitoring of energy consumption, historical data analysis, KPIs (e.g., kWh/unit), alerts, and reviews – leading to measurable, lasting savings.\
   An example of an ISO 50001-compliant EMS is [OmniEnergy](https://omnienergy.pl/).

4. **Better investment decisions**\
   EMS data support ROI calculations for upgrades (compressors, drives, heat recovery, lighting, furnace control, etc.)\
   They also allow precise estimation of the **Technical Cost of Production (TKW)**.

## Example cost comparison

When considering an EMS implementation, it is important to understand the long-term costs of recurring audits.

**Market assumptions (example):**\
An energy audit costs **PLN 40,000 every 4 years**.\
Assume a one-time EMS implementation cost of **PLN 10,000** and an annual system subscription of **PLN 7,000**.

### 4-year horizon (first audit cycle)

| Item | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Total (4 years) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EMS – one-time setup | 10,000 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 10,000 |
| EMS – annual subscription (7,000/year) | 7,000 | 7,000 | 7,000 | 7,000 | 28,000 |
| **Total EMS (without energy savings)** | **17,000** | **7,000** | **7,000** | **7,000** | **38,000** |
| Energy audit (every 4 years) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 40,000 | 40,000 |

---

Additionally, EMS implementations often bring **7–15% annual energy savings**.\
For a company spending PLN 1,000,000 per year on energy, a 7% reduction equals **PLN 70,000 in yearly savings**.

## How to design an EMS that “pays for itself”

1. **Define KPIs and business goals** – before investing, determine your objectives and how to measure them.\
   Example KPIs: *kWh/unit*, *kWh/ton*, *kWh/working hour*.

2. **Online monitoring** – select key utilities (electricity, gas, steam, compressed air) and set up real-time deviation alerts.

3. **Historical data analysis** – data is the fuel of industrial optimization.\
   The [OmniEnergy](https://omnienergy.pl/) system includes an energy-data analytics module enhanced with AI models.

4. **Rapid response procedures** – define alarm thresholds to enable immediate action in case of abnormal consumption or equipment failure.

5. **Prepare for ISO 50001 certification** – ensures formal exemption from audits and organizes compliance evidence.\
   Certification also strengthens your company’s image as a sustainability-oriented organization.

## Summary

The new EED shifts responsibility for improving energy efficiency directly onto companies.\
With rising energy costs, implementing an EMS is not only a path to efficiency but also a **regulatory obligation**.\
For manufacturing plants, **EMS/ISO 50001** is the safest and most profitable route:\
legal compliance, freedom from recurring audits, lower energy bills, and a stronger sustainability reputation.
