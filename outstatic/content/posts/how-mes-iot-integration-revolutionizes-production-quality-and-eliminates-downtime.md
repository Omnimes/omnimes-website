The MES market is growing at a rate of 14.1% annually, reaching USD 41.78 billion by 2032, while Industry 5.0 puts humans at the center of production, combining sustainability with advanced technologies. Integrating MES with IoT in the Industry 5.0 era is not just a trend—it is a necessity for companies aiming to remain competitive.

### Introduction: The Era of Industry 5.0 in Manufacturing

While industry is still implementing Industry 4.0 solutions, Industry 5.0 introduces a new paradigm based on three pillars: sustainability, resilience, and a human-centric approach. In this context, the integration of Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) with the Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a cornerstone of digital transformation—not only automating processes but also making them more human and environmentally friendly.

The global MES market will grow from USD 16.57 billion in 2025 to USD 41.78 billion in 2032, driven by the increasing demand for integrated IoT and AI solutions in manufacturing.

### What Is Industry 5.0 and Why Does It Matter?

**Definition and Key Principles**

Industry 5.0 is the evolution of Industry 4.0, bringing humans back to the center of production while leveraging advanced technologies to create more sustainable and resilient systems. Unlike Industry 4.0, which focused primarily on automation, Industry 5.0 emphasizes:

- **Human–machine collaboration:** Cobots (collaborative robots) working alongside people, mirroring movements, and improving safety

- **Sustainable production:** Use of renewable energy and waste minimization

- **Product personalization:** Large-scale production of customized products

**Business Impact**

The global smart manufacturing market reached USD 349.81 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow to USD 790.91 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 14.0%. This dynamic reflects how quickly industries are adopting Industry 5.0 solutions.

### MES in the Industry 5.0 Era: The Evolution of Execution Systems

**Traditional MES Focused On:**

- Data collection

- Quality control

- Production planning

**MES 5.0 Brings:**

- **Intelligent predictive analytics:** Industrial AI valued at USD 43.6 billion in 2024, forecast to reach USD 153.9 billion by 2030

- **Human-AI collaboration:** Decision-support systems for operators

- **Sustainable resource management:** Optimized use of energy and materials

**Business Benefits**

- **Downtime reduction:** 20–30% via predictive maintenance

- **OEE improvement:** +15–25%

- **Quality cost reduction:** 10–40% via real-time monitoring

### IoT as a Catalyst for Transformation

**IoT Market Growth:** from USD 119.4 billion in 2024 to USD 286.3 billion in 2029

**IoT Layers in Manufacturing:**

- Sensor layer: temperature, vibration, pressure

- Communication layer: 5G, WiFi 6, LoRaWAN

- Analytics layer: edge computing, cloud analytics

- Application layer: MES, ERP, SCADA integration

**Key IoT Technologies in Industry 5.0**

- **Edge Computing:** real-time processing, &lt;1ms latency, improved security

- **5G Connectivity:** RedCap for AI-enhanced safety, massive device density, URLLC (ultra-reliable low-latency communication)

### Practical Applications of MES-IoT Integration

**Real-Time Quality Control**

- Traditional: post-factum quality checks, high scrap costs

- MES-IoT: inline monitoring, predictive quality analytics, human-in-the-loop alerts

**Predictive Maintenance**

- Technologies: vibration analysis, thermal imaging, oil analysis

- ROI: 25–50% fewer unplanned downtimes, 20–40% longer machine life, 15–30% lower maintenance costs

### Omnimes: A Modern Industry 5.0 MES

- **Real-time monitoring** of production processes
