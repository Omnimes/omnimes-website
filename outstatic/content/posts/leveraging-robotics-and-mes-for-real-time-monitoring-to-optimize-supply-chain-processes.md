# Introduction

In today's dynamic business world, **supply chain process optimization** is becoming a key element of competitiveness. The use of technologies such as robotics and **MES** (Manufacturing Execution System) enables real-time monitoring of processes and quick decision-making. In this article, we will discuss how these technologies work together to improve the efficiency and flexibility of the supply chain.

## How Robotics Supports Supply Chain Processes

Robotics plays an increasingly important role in automating production processes. By implementing robots in warehouses and on production lines, companies can:

- **Increase efficiency** – Robots can work 24/7, significantly boosting production rates.
- **Reduce errors** – Automation decreases the risk of human errors, leading to higher product quality.
- **Lower costs** – Despite initial investments, robots can yield savings over time by reducing labor costs and increasing process efficiency.

## The Role of MES in Monitoring Processes

MES systems are crucial for real-time production management. They enable:

- **Data collection** – These systems gather data from various sources, allowing for continuous monitoring of production status.
- **Data analysis** – By employing advanced algorithms, MES can analyze collected data and provide insights into performance, quality, and production costs.
- **Resource management** – MES systems help optimize resource utilization, leading to better production planning and minimized downtime.

## Integration of Robotics with MES

The integration of robotics with MES brings several benefits, including:

- **Real-time monitoring** – By connecting robots with MES systems, it is possible to monitor their operations in real-time. For example, if a robot detects a problem, the MES system immediately informs the relevant personnel of the need for intervention.
- **Process optimization** – Analyzing data from robots allows for the identification and elimination of bottlenecks in the production process.
- **Increased flexibility** – In the event of changing product demand, robots can be quickly reconfigured for new tasks, allowing for a faster response to market needs.

## Example of ROI from Implementing Robotics and MES

Let’s assume a company invested 500,000 PLN in robots and an MES system. After implementation, due to increased efficiency, the company achieved:

- **30% increase in production**
- **20% reduction in operational costs**

Let's calculate the ROI:

1. **Revenue increase**: If revenues were 2,000,000 PLN, a 30% increase equals 600,000 PLN.
2. **Savings**: A 20% reduction in costs from 1,500,000 PLN equals 300,000 PLN.
3. **Total profit**: 600,000 PLN (revenue increase) + 300,000 PLN (savings) = 900,000 PLN.
4. **ROI**: (900,000 PLN - 500,000 PLN) / 500,000 PLN * 100% = 80%.

By implementing robotics and the MES system, the company achieved an 80% return on investment within the first year.

## Conclusions

The integration of robotics and MES systems is key to **optimizing supply chain processes**. With real-time monitoring capabilities, companies can respond more quickly to changes in production and manage their resources more effectively. The OmniMES system, as an advanced MES solution, supports these processes by enabling better data management and production optimization.
