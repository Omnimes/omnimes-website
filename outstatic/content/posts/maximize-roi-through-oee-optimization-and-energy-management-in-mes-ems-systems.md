### Introduction: The Era of Smart Energy Management

In the age of Industry 5.0, where energy efficiency becomes a key differentiator, manufacturing enterprises face unprecedented challenges. According to the new EU Directive 2023/1791 on energy efficiency, member states must achieve an average annual energy savings rate of 1.49% between 2024–2030. This means that companies must radically rethink their approach to energy management.

A crucial tool in this transformation is the optimization of the OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) index through intelligent energy management in MES-class systems. In both Industry 4.0 and 5.0, OEE plays a key role in ROI planning, reliability, and production stability.

### Regulatory Foundations: EU Directives as a Catalyst for Change

**Legal obligations for enterprises**\
Under the new law, energy management systems will become mandatory for large energy consumers (exceeding 85 TJ of annual energy consumption). Enterprises consuming more than 10 TJ will be required to conduct an energy audit and prepare an action plan. This is not just a compliance requirement but also a strategic opportunity to gain a competitive advantage.

**Impact on industry**\
The directive requires the public sector to lead by example: EU public institutions must reduce their total final energy consumption by at least 1.9% annually. The private sector, though less restricted, must prepare for similar standards in the near future.

### Industry 5.0: A New Paradigm of Energy Efficiency

**Human at the center of sustainable production**\
The concept of Industry 5.0 combines human-machine collaboration, sustainability, and resilience. Unlike Industry 4.0, which focused on automation, Industry 5.0 places humans at the center of processes while maximizing energy efficiency.

**Technological pillars of Industry 5.0**\
Industry 5.0 leverages IoT, AI, and data analytics to control energy consumption at every stage of production. These technologies enable:

- Reduction of energy losses by 15–30% through real-time monitoring

- Cost optimization with demand forecasting

- Automation of energy management processes

---

### OEE as a Tool for Energy Optimization

**Classical formula and its evolution**\
OEE consists of three components: Availability, Performance, and Quality. Standard formula:

`OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality`

World-class OEE reference value: 85% (90% availability, 95% performance, 99% quality).

**Extending with an energy component: OEEE**\
A pioneering approach is OEEE (Overall Equipment Energy Effectiveness), which considers the energy intensity of production processes. This allows for:

- Holistic efficiency assessment

- Identification of energy-intensive processes

- Energy cost optimization in performance context

**Business benefits**\
Optimization of two robotic welding lines generated **2,500,000 PLN in profits** — proving how systematic OEE improvements deliver measurable ROI.
