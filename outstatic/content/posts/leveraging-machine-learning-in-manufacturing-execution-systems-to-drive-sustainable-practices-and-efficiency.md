# Introduction

In the era of Industry 4.0, **machine learning** (ML) is becoming a key element in **Manufacturing Execution Systems** (MES). By integrating ML, companies can not only increase production efficiency but also implement sustainable practices that are essential in today's world. In this article, we will discuss how the use of machine learning in MES systems, such as **OmniMES**, can contribute to improved efficiency and sustainability.

## Understanding MES Systems and Their Role in Production

MES systems are crucial for managing production processes. They offer:
- Monitoring of machine performance
- Quality management
- Optimization of production processes

By integrating with IoT technologies, MES collects vast amounts of data from various sources. Machine learning allows for the analysis of this data, leading to better business decisions.

## How Does Machine Learning Support Sustainability?

Sustainability in industry involves minimizing negative environmental impacts. Machine learning can help achieve this by:
- **Optimizing energy consumption**: ML algorithms can analyze energy consumption data and suggest changes in processes to reduce energy costs and CO2 emissions.
- **Waste management**: Machine learning can assist in identifying areas where production waste can be reduced, impacting efficiency and sustainability.
- **Predicting failures**: By analyzing data from sensors, MES systems can predict machine failures, allowing for early repairs and reducing production downtime.

## Examples of Machine Learning Applications in MES

### Production Optimization

Example: In a company producing electronic components, ML algorithms were implemented to analyze data from machines. As a result, production efficiency increased by 20% through the optimization of machine work schedules.

### Reducing Energy Consumption

Example: In a metal processing plant, an ML model was applied to analyze energy consumption. After implementing the recommendations, the company reduced energy costs by 15%, contributing to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions.

## ROI from Implementing an MES System with ML

Implementing an MES system with machine learning functionalities brings measurable financial benefits. Sample ROI calculations may look as follows:
1. **Implementation cost of the system**: 200,000 PLN
2. **Annual savings from increased efficiency**: 100,000 PLN
3. **Annual savings from reduced energy costs**: 30,000 PLN
4. **Reduced costs associated with downtime**: 50,000 PLN

**Total annual savings**: 180,000 PLN

**ROI after 2 years**: 
- Total profit: 360,000 PLN
- ROI = (360,000 PLN - 200,000 PLN) / 200,000 PLN * 100% = 80%

Such data shows that investing in MES systems with ML can quickly pay off and additionally bring benefits in terms of sustainability.

## Challenges of Implementing ML in MES

Despite numerous benefits, implementing machine learning in MES systems comes with certain challenges:
- **Integration complexity**: Connecting various systems and data sources can be complicated.
- **Data requirements**: Machine learning requires large datasets, which can be problematic in some industries.
- **Initial costs**: Implementing ML technology involves investments that can be significant.

## Conclusion

Machine learning in MES systems, such as **OmniMES**, opens new opportunities for the industry, contributing to increased efficiency and sustainability. Through data analysis and process automation, companies can achieve better financial results while minimizing their environmental impact.
