Choosing between a cloud-based system and an on-premise solution is one of the most common decisions faced by manufacturing companies considering the implementation of production control systems. Both approaches have their advantages and limitations — they differ in terms of cost, security, deployment speed, and configuration flexibility.\
This article explains the key differences and shows how the **OmniMES** system adapts to various business needs, offering both deployment models: **OmniCloud (SaaS)** and **OmniMES On-Premise**.

## Cloud System – Flexibility and Quick Start

Cloud-based solutions (SaaS – *Software as a Service*) operate on external servers provided by the vendor. The user accesses the system through a web browser, without the need to install or maintain their own IT infrastructure.

The biggest advantage of this model is the **speed of deployment**. In the case of **OmniMES Cloud**, all you need is to create an account, configure the basic settings, and you can start working almost immediately.\
No long-term contracts or investments in servers are required — it’s an ideal solution for companies that want to test the system or begin digital transformation step by step.

Another benefit is the **low entry cost**. In the SaaS model, you pay a subscription fee that includes software access, infrastructure maintenance, updates, and backups. This means the company doesn’t have to engage its own IT resources to manage the system.

On the other hand, cloud solutions have certain **limitations**. Data is stored on external servers (e.g., VPS provided by the vendor), which means its security depends on the level of protection guaranteed by the operator. For some manufacturing companies — especially those operating in regulated industries or dealing with strategic data — this can be a limiting factor.\
Cloud environments also have restrictions when it comes to customization and long-term historical data storage, which can be a challenge for in-depth production analyses.

## On-Premise System – Full Control and Security

The **On-Premise** model means the system is installed on servers located within the company’s infrastructure. This gives the organization full responsibility for the environment, backups, updates, and data security — but also **complete control** over every aspect of the system.

The main advantage of On-Premise deployment is **security and independence**. Production data never leaves the local network, minimizing the risk of loss or unauthorized access. This is especially important for facilities subject to strict security policies — such as in the **automotive, aerospace, or pharmaceutical** industries.

On-Premise systems also offer greater **scalability and customization**. They can be integrated with any devices, expanded with new modules, or adapted to custom reporting requirements specific to the production process. This allows the system to evolve along with the company, without the limitations typical of cloud environments.

The drawback of this approach is the **higher entry threshold** — it requires purchasing licenses, servers, and often signing an implementation contract. System maintenance also demands a dedicated IT team.\
However, for companies with sufficient technical resources and a need for full independence, this investment brings long-term and measurable benefits.

## Cost and Security – Two Different Philosophies

From a financial perspective, the **cloud model** is more predictable, based on subscription payments. The company pays only for what it uses, with no need to invest in infrastructure.\
In contrast, **On-Premise** has higher initial costs, but once implemented, the system can operate for many years — though server maintenance, license renewals, and technical support must be considered.

When it comes to **security**, the differences are clearer. In the cloud, data is stored on external VPS servers that provide a defined security level, but users don’t have full control over it.\
In the On-Premise model, all data remains within the company’s infrastructure — this option is preferred by organizations that value confidentiality and want full control over their security layers.

## OmniMES – Two Deployment Models Tailored to Your Needs

**OmniMES** is designed to meet the needs of both small manufacturing plants and large enterprises.\
It offers two flexible licensing options: **OmniCloud (SaaS)** and **OmniMES On-Premise**.

| **Function** | **OmniCloud (SaaS)** | **On-Premise** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start without formalities | Yes | Requires contract |
| Own server | No | Required |
| Entry threshold | **Low** | **Medium or high** |
| Full control over system and servers | No | Yes |
| Automatic signal detection | No | Yes |
| Signal recording from system startup | No | Yes |
| System expansion with new modules | Limited | Yes |
| Data security | **External VPS** | **Local infrastructure** |
| Data retention period | Limited (80–365 days) | Unlimited |
| Unlimited number of signals | No (limit of 1000 signals) | Yes (requires appropriate license) |

Thanks to this flexibility, every company can choose the solution that best matches its **security, scalability, and budget** requirements.\
Companies looking to start digitalization quickly and cost-effectively can choose **OmniCloud**, while those prioritizing **integration, independence, and control** can opt for **OmniMES On-Premise**.
