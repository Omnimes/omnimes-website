**The role of a production manager is becoming more complex every year. Modern factories demand not only smooth operations and on-time execution, but also cost optimization, rapid reaction to deviations, and building a culture of continuous improvement. In such an environment, traditional Excel sheets, manual reports, or intuition-based decisions are no longer enough.**

This is where **OmniMES** proves its value — a system that gives the production manager tools to make informed, fast, and accurate decisions.

## **A single source of truth — real-time data**

One of the biggest obstacles in production management is the lack of up-to-date and reliable information. A manager cannot react to problems that become visible only hours later or at the end of a shift. OmniMES eliminates this issue by presenting real-time data: from produced quantities and downtimes to machine performance and product quality.

Information that once arrived with delays is now available instantly — on a computer, tablet, or shop-floor screen. The manager doesn’t have to guess. They simply see what is happening at any moment.

---

## **Full control over downtimes and loss causes**

Most production losses come from small, often unnoticed events — micro-stops, speed drops, or quality issues. Without a system, these are difficult to detect and even harder to analyze. OmniMES automatically registers every event and links it to a specific machine, shift, and order.

A production manager can finally understand *why* efficiency drops instead of only seeing that the result is worse. The system highlights the causes of losses, shows their magnitude, and helps prioritize improvement actions.

---

## **Monitoring OEE and key process indicators**

OmniMES automatically calculates OEE, availability, performance, and quality indicators — both for machines and production orders. The manager can analyze shift performance, compare lines, identify deviations, and measure how improvement initiatives impact results.

It’s a tool that enables fact-based decision-making rather than relying on subjective impressions. The data clearly shows where the company is losing time, money, and capacity.

---

## **Support for daily operational decisions**

The system doesn’t only report — it supports day-to-day management. A production manager can quickly assess whether an order is on schedule, whether additional resources are needed, or whether priorities should be adjusted.

OmniMES also helps detect problems before they become visible in the results — such as cycle time degradation or rising numbers of micro-stops. This allows for proactive, not reactive, action.

---

## **Better communication with operators, maintenance, and planners**

Production works well only when information flows clearly and quickly. OmniMES provides a shared reporting environment for operators, planners, maintenance teams, and management. Everyone works with the same data, which eliminates misunderstandings and shortens decision-making time.

The manager can easily set priorities, communicate issues, and analyze recurring failures or quality drops — without manually collecting data from multiple sources.

---

## **OmniMES as the foundation of continuous improvement**

The greatest value of OmniMES is its support for a culture of continuous improvement. A production manager can track the impact of introduced changes, compare results to historical data, and take further development steps.

The system creates full process transparency — a cornerstone of every modern factory. Data not only reveals problems but also helps build a long-term production development strategy.

---

## **OmniMES — a tool that genuinely supports the production manager**

Managing production today requires tools that are fast, precise, and reliable. OmniMES provides exactly that: full process transparency, detailed data analytics, and ready-made reports that support daily decisions and long-term improvements.

If you want a solution that simplifies production management and increases efficiency, OmniMES is the natural choice.
