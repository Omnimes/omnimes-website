### Sparkplug B Protocol with MES Systems: A Modern Approach to Failure Prediction and Energy Optimization in Industry

#### Introduction

The ongoing digital transformation in industry requires advanced communication solutions that ensure system interoperability and enable efficient use of operational data. The Sparkplug B protocol, an extension of the MQTT standard for industrial applications, provides a structured approach to communication within the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Its integration with Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) opens new opportunities in predictive maintenance and energy optimization in production processes.

#### Technical Characteristics of Sparkplug B

**Architecture and Standards**\
Sparkplug B (version 3.0.0), developed by the Eclipse Foundation, defines data structures and communication mechanisms in MQTT environments for industrial applications. The protocol operates with the following components:

- **Edge Node** – representing an industrial gateway or device

- **Device** – physical devices connected to the Edge Node

- **Primary Host Application** – central management system (e.g., SCADA, MES)

**State Management Mechanisms**:

- **Birth Certificates** – define device data structures at initial connection

- **Death Certificates** – automatic notification of communication loss

- **State Management** – real-time device state handling

**Technical Advantages**:

- Data compression with Google Protocol Buffers (60–80% reduction)

- Deterministic communication via Sequence Numbers

- Metadata for each data point (type, unit, timestamps)

- Auto-discovery of new devices

#### Sparkplug B Integration with MES

**Integration Architecture**:\
OT Layer ← Sparkplug B Gateway ← MQTT Broker ← MES Platform

**Key Components**:

- MQTT Broker with Sparkplug B support (HiveMQ, Eclipse Mosquitto)

- Data Historian for time-series storage

- Analytics Engine with machine learning capabilities

- API Gateway for integration with upper-level systems

**Example Data Structure for Production Equipment**:

- **Operational Metrics**: cycle time, part count, equipment status, quality metrics

- **Energy Parameters**: active power, power factor, consumption, harmonics

- **Predictive Indicators**: vibration, temperature profiles, lubrication pressure, motor current signature

#### Predictive Failure Implementation

Analytical approaches:

1. **Statistical Process Control (SPC)** – trend detection, 6-sigma, control charts

2. **Machine Learning Models** – Isolation Forest, LSTM networks, Random Forest

3. **Physics-Based Models** – ISO 13373 bearing degradation, ISO 10816 vibration analysis, IEC 60204 thermography

**Efficiency Metrics** (McKinsey Global Institute):

- Unplanned downtime reduction: 30–50%

- Machine lifetime extension: 20–40%

- Maintenance cost reduction: 10–40%

- OEE improvement: 15–25%

#### Energy Optimization

- **Monitoring**: measurement granularity at plant, line, and machine level

- **Key Indicators**: SEC, PUE, energy intensity ratio

- **Strategies**: load scheduling, equipment efficiency optimization, VFD implementation

#### Implementation Challenges

- **System Integration**: protocol compatibility, time synchronization, cybersecurity (IEC 62443)

- **Data Management**: 1–10 GB/day per line, &lt;100ms latency, 99.5% uptime

- **Organizational Aspects**: IIoT training, Sparkplug B certification, change management

#### Future Perspectives

- **Edge Computing**: latency &lt;10ms, autonomous decision-making

- **Digital Twins**: real-time optimization, predictive analytics in virtual environments

- **AI/ML**: federated learning, explainable AI for decision support

- **Standardization**: driven by Eclipse Foundation, OASIS, IIC, OPC Foundation

#### Summary and Recommendations

Sparkplug B integration with MES is a strategic investment for modern production. Benefits include:

- **Operational**: higher communication reliability, 15–30% lower operating costs, improved quality metrics

- **Strategic**: foundation for Industry 4.0, increased agility, competitive advantage via data-driven decision making

**Implementation Recommendations**:

- Pilot project on a single line

- Phased rollout across the factory

- Team training investments

- Certified vendor selection

- ROI measurement with success criteria

Successful deployment requires collaboration between IT, OT, and operations teams, alongside long-term management commitment.

**The OmniMES system by Multiprojekt implements this technology in practice. Machine and sensor data are transferred using the Sparkplug B standard, ensuring consistency, security, and real-time availability.**
