## Smart Manufacturing and Predictive Maintenance in MES with Sparkplug B

### Perspective: Enhancing energy efficiency in smart manufacturing

In the era of **Industry 4.0** and **smart manufacturing**, the integration of MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems) with modern communication standards has become a strategic priority. One such standard is **Sparkplug B**, which ensures reliable, structured data exchange across the **Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)**. By leveraging Sparkplug B, manufacturers can enable **predictive maintenance**, optimize energy usage, and increase **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)**.

### What is Sparkplug B?

**Sparkplug B** is an open communication specification designed for IIoT applications, built on **MQTT**. Its main features include:

- **Structured data organization** – standardized payloads simplify analysis, reporting, and integration.

- **Device state management** – built-in online/offline awareness ensures reliable machine connectivity.

- **Seamless MES integration** – real-time data can be directly consumed by MES, ERP, or analytics platforms.

These capabilities make Sparkplug B a **cornerstone technology** for digital factories.

### Applying Sparkplug B in MES

When integrated with MES, Sparkplug B enables:

1. **Real-time machine data collection** for continuous monitoring.

2. **Predictive maintenance** – early anomaly detection based on historical and live data.

3. **Energy optimization** – analyzing consumption patterns and correlating them with process efficiency.

4. **Improved KPI management** – real-time insights into OEE, MTBF, MTTR, and production throughput.

### Case study: metal processing plant

- **Problem**: frequent unplanned downtime and high energy costs.

- **Solution**: MES with Sparkplug B integration for machine monitoring and predictive analytics.

- **Results**:

  - downtime reduced by **30%**,

  - energy consumption lowered by **20%**,

  - OEE improved by **12%**.

### Business benefits

MES combined with Sparkplug B provides:

- **Higher reliability** through predictive maintenance and proactive interventions.

- **Lower operational costs** from reduced downtime and energy efficiency.

- **Improved product quality** through consistent process monitoring.

- **Scalability** – new machines and production lines can be easily added to the IIoT ecosystem.

### Implementation challenges

- **System integration** with legacy IT/OT environments (ERP, SCADA, existing MES).

- **Training** – operators and maintenance teams must adapt to new standards.

- **Data management** – large volumes of IIoT data require analytics, edge computing, and security policies.

### Conclusion

**Sparkplug B** strengthens MES as a central platform for **data-driven manufacturing**. It enables companies to:

- save energy,

- increase reliability,

- enhance product quality,

- and achieve higher operational efficiency.

The **OmniMES** platform supports these goals by providing modular, flexible solutions for Sparkplug B adoption and other Industry 4.0 technologies.
