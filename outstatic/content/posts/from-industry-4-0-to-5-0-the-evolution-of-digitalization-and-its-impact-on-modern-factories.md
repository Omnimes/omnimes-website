### Introduction

For more than a decade, industrial digitalization has set new directions in manufacturing. The term *Industry 4.0* became a symbol of the Fourth Industrial Revolution – the era of automation, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Today, *Industry 5.0* is gaining traction. It does not replace 4.0 but builds on it, adding a new dimension: the integration of humans and technology in a sustainable and responsible way.

### Where do the numbers come from?

The numbering of “industrial revolutions” is conventional and helps to organize the historical development of technology:

1. **Industry 1.0 (late 18th century):** mechanization, steam and water power.

2. **Industry 2.0 (19th/20th century):** electricity, assembly lines, mass production.

3. **Industry 3.0 (1970s):** process automation, first IT systems, industrial robots.

4. **Industry 4.0 (from \~2011):** digitalization, IoT, Big Data, artificial intelligence, smart manufacturing.

5. **Industry 5.0 (from \~2020):** human-machine collaboration, mass personalization, sustainability, AI ethics.

Each stage does not negate the previous one but expands on it, responding to new economic and social needs.

### Key features of Industry 4.0

- **Automation and robotics:** machines take over an increasing range of tasks.

- **Internet of Things (IoT):** devices communicate with each other and with management systems.

- **Big Data and predictive analytics:** sensor data helps predict failures and optimize production.

- **System integration:** from the shop floor to ERP and MES systems, everything is digitally connected.

- **Smart Factory:** the factory becomes an autonomous organism capable of independent, data-driven decisions.

**Business impact:** cost reduction, higher efficiency, faster market response.

### Key features of Industry 5.0

- **Human-centric:** people return to the center of the process – technologies support decisions rather than replace them.

- **Mass personalization:** a shift from mass production to customized manufacturing (e.g., personalized medicine, on-demand production).

- **AI and cobots:** intelligent machines work alongside humans, adapting to their needs.

- **Sustainability:** focus on ecology, circular economy, and reducing carbon footprint.

- **AI ethics and responsibility:** implementing AI with respect for privacy, human rights, and safety.

**Business impact:** building competitive advantage through user- and eco-friendly innovation, not just cost optimization.

### Practical differences – 4.0 vs 5.0

| **Aspect** | **Industry 4.0** | **Industry 5.0** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goal | Efficiency and automation | Human-machine collaboration |
| Core technology | IoT, AI, Big Data, automation | Cobots, ethical AI, personalization |
| Human role | System supervisor, limited role | Process partner, creator |
| Production model | Mass production, cost-driven | Customized, sustainable production |
| Business value | Lower costs, faster processes | New business models, customer loyalty, ESG |

### Impact on modern factory digitalization

- **Integration with MES/ERP systems:** increasing importance of platforms connecting production and business data (e.g., OmniMES, SAP, Siemens Opcenter).

- **New business models:** subscriptions, on-demand production, digital twins.

- **Employee competencies:** engineers must combine IT skills with human factors such as ergonomics, safety, and AI collaboration.

- **ESG investments:** digitalization also supports environmental reporting and EU compliance (e.g., Fit for 55).

### Conclusion

Industry 4.0 and 5.0 are not competing concepts but stages of the same digital revolution. **4.0** focuses on automation and data, while **5.0** emphasizes human-technology collaboration and sustainability. This means that factories are not only becoming *smart* but also *responsible and adaptable*.

For business, the difference is fundamental: from a *“cost factory”* to a *“value factory”* – where customers, employees, and the environment benefit alongside the enterprise.

### Next steps in digitalization

Companies aiming to implement Industry 4.0 and 5.0 concepts need systems that not only collect data but also support decision-making and ensure full process integration.

One such solution is **OmniMES** – a proprietary MES-class system that combines production digitalization with modern Industry 5.0 trends. More information can be found here:  [www.omnimes.com](https://www.omnimes.com)
