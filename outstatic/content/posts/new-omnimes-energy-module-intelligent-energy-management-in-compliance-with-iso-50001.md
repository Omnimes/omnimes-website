As electricity costs continue to rise faster than production margins, companies are increasingly looking for ways to achieve lasting reductions in utility consumption. The answer to these needs is the new **energy module** in the **OmniMES system**, which functions as an **Energy Management System (EMS)**.\
It enables companies to **monitor, analyze, and optimize energy consumption** across the entire plant — using the same data already utilized by the MES system.

This means there’s **no need to install sensors or measuring devices twice** — the same data can serve both MES and EMS purposes, significantly reducing implementation time and cost.

### What is an EMS?

An **Energy Management System (EMS)** supports the management of a company’s energy consumption. Its role goes beyond recording data — it helps analyze and identify areas where **real savings** can be achieved.\
The EMS collects data from meters, sensors, and controllers, analyzes consumption trends, and assists in planning actions to improve energy efficiency.

When integrated with the MES system, the EMS becomes a **powerful operational management tool** — allowing users to compare energy consumption with production plans, monitor machine efficiency, and react in real time to any deviations.

### Key Concepts: SEU, EnPI, and EMP

To effectively implement energy management in line with **ISO 50001**, it’s important to understand three key concepts:

- **SEU (Significant Energy Use)** – areas or devices responsible for the highest energy consumption in the plant. These are the primary targets for optimization efforts, as they yield the greatest benefits. Examples include compressor stations, industrial furnaces, or injection molding lines.

- **EnPI (Energy Performance Indicator)** – an energy efficiency metric (e.g., kWh per produced unit). It helps track performance over time and measure the impact of improvement actions.

- **EMP (Energy Management Plan)** – a structured plan defining goals, timelines, responsibilities, and methods for monitoring progress in energy efficiency improvement.

The EMS supports all these components, enabling **continuous improvement and compliance with ISO 50001 requirements**.

### EMS and ISO 50001 – Not Just Technology, but Also Legal Benefits

The **ISO 50001** standard defines requirements for energy management systems in enterprises. Organizations that implement and maintain such a system may be **exempt from mandatory periodic energy audits** required by Polish law (Energy Efficiency Act).

This means that, beyond direct cost savings from reduced energy use, implementing an EMS also helps avoid **administrative costs and obligations**, which in large companies can reach **tens of thousands of PLN every four years**.

### Features of an ISO 50001-Compliant EMS

To support ISO 50001 certification and deliver real efficiency improvements, an EMS should provide:

- real-time monitoring of energy consumption,

- identification of SEUs and trend analysis,

- calculation of EnPI indicators for processes and devices,

- reporting on EMP goal achievement,

- integration with the MES production system,

- visualization of energy data and alerts for deviations,

- data archiving for documentation of progress and savings.

All these capabilities are available in the **new OmniMES Energy Module**, which merges production and energy data into a **single, coherent analytical system**.

### Example: Savings and ROI Calculation

Assume the plant’s average annual electricity consumption is **2,000 MWh**, with an energy cost of **600 PLN/MWh** — that’s **1.2 million PLN per year**.

After implementing the **OmniMES Energy Module** and executing an **Energy Management Plan (EMP)**, typical savings range between **5% and 10% annually**, achieved through better monitoring and the elimination of inefficiencies.

Using a conservative estimate of **5% savings**, this equals **60,000 PLN saved per year**.

| Item | Cost (PLN) |
| --- | --- |
| System implementation | 20,000 |
| Annual maintenance (license, service, updates) | 10,000 |
| **Total cost in year one** | **30,000** |
| **Annual savings** | **60,000** |

This means **ROI occurs in less than six months**, and in subsequent years the system generates **real profits**.\
Additionally, the company gains **data needed for ISO 50001 compliance** and can **avoid the cost of mandatory energy audits**, saving another several to tens of thousands of PLN.

### OmniMES Energy Module – Data That Works Twice

The new **OmniMES Energy Module** leverages the **same process data already collected by the MES system**.\
This eliminates the need for additional sensors, wiring, or separate database setups. All measurements are **consistent, synchronized, and available** in both production and energy contexts.

This makes it possible to **link machine performance analysis with energy consumption** — for example, calculating the energy cost per product or comparing energy efficiency across production shifts.\
Such synergy between MES and EMS unlocks **new opportunities for production, maintenance, and finance departments alike**.

### Take Control of Your Energy with OmniMES

With the new **OmniMES Energy Module**, you can not only monitor energy consumption but **actively manage it** — following the **PDCA continuous improvement cycle** and meeting **ISO 50001 standards**.\
It’s a solution that allows you to **save energy, reduce costs, and ensure full legal compliance** at the same time.
