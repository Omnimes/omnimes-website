# Introduction

**Perspective: Connected factories in the era of Industry 4.0**

In the face of increasing competition and market demands, **production efficiency** becomes a key element of management strategies in industrial facilities. Utilizing **connected factories** and technologies such as **IoT**, **data analytics**, and **real-time monitoring** can significantly enhance production processes. In this article, we will present practical approaches to optimizing **resource planning** in the context of connected factories.

## IoT Integration in Production

The introduction of **IoT devices** into production lines enables real-time data collection, which in turn allows for:
- Monitoring machine performance
- Identifying issues in production processes
- Optimizing production schedules

With IoT integration, production engineers can quickly respond to changes in production conditions, leading to increased **OEE** (Overall Equipment Effectiveness). For example, MES systems like **OmniMES** can integrate data from various sources, allowing for better resource management.

## Data Analytics and Decision-Making

Data collection is just the first step. The key is processing and analyzing that data. Utilizing analytical tools allows for:
- Identifying production patterns
- Predicting machine failures
- Optimizing production quality

Example: In a manufacturing facility that implemented data analytics, it was calculated that through better identification of quality issues, waste was reduced by 15%. With production costs at €500,000 per month, this translates to savings of €75,000 monthly.

## Real-Time Monitoring

**Real-time monitoring** is an element that allows for immediate responses to issues. Systems like OmniMES can provide data on machine performance and production status in real-time, enabling:
- Immediate identification of downtimes
- Quick analysis of problem causes
- Increased production efficiency

## ROI Example from MES Implementation

To illustrate the benefits of implementing an MES system, consider the following example:

1. **Availability (downtime)**: The facility had an average downtime of 20% per month. With production at €500,000, losses amounted to €100,000.
2. **Performance (reduced speed)**: Efficiency was at 75% instead of 85%. Performance losses accounted for another €50,000 monthly.
3. **Quality (defects)**: Waste was 10% of production, which at €500,000 resulted in €50,000.

Total losses amounted to €200,000 monthly. After implementing the MES system, the facility reduced losses by 50%, resulting in savings of €100,000 monthly. This value translates into a quick return on investment.

## Conclusion

Utilizing connected factories and modern technologies, such as IoT and data analytics, allows for significant improvements in production efficiency. The **OmniMES system** offers solutions that support these processes, enabling better resource management and production optimization. Implementing such technologies is crucial for gaining a competitive edge in the market.
