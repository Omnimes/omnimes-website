## Introduction

Modern industry is at the heart of digital transformation, where **Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)** with **real-time data analytics** form a cornerstone of **Industry 5.0**. According to a 2023 McKinsey Global Institute report, companies that deploy advanced analytics in production achieve, on average, a 15–20% productivity increase and a 25% reduction in defects.

## What are MES systems in the context of Industry 5.0?

**Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)** are comprehensive IT solutions that manage shop-floor production processes in real time. Contemporary MES platforms, such as **OmniMES**, integrate seamlessly with **ERP**, **SCADA**, and **IoT** systems to create an intelligent industrial ecosystem.

### Key components of modern MES systems

**Production Data Collection Module**

- Automatic recording of process parameters

- Integration with IoT sensors and PLCs

- Support for communication protocols (OPC UA, MQTT, Modbus)

**Quality Control System**

- Real-time monitoring of parameters

- Automatic detection of deviations from standards

- Integration with vision and metrology systems

**Predictive Analytics Module**

- Machine-learning algorithms for failure prediction

- Trend and production pattern analysis

- Process parameter optimization

## Real-Time Data Analytics: Technologies and Benefits

### Core technologies

**Edge Computing**\
Processing data directly on the production line reduces latency from 50–100 ms to under 10 ms—critical for processes requiring immediate response.

**Machine Learning and AI**

- **Supervised learning**: Identification of defect patterns with up to 99.5% accuracy

- **Unsupervised learning**: Detection of previously unknown anomalies

- **Deep Learning**: Image analysis from industrial cameras

**Big Data Analytics**\
Real-time processing of petabytes of production data using technologies such as Apache Kafka and Apache Spark.

### Documented business benefits

A 2024 Boston Consulting Group study of 500 manufacturing companies found:

**Quality metric improvements:**

- Defect reduction: 30–50%

- Increase in **First Pass Yield** by 25%

- Time to detect issues shortened from 4 hours to 2 minutes

**Cost optimization:**

- Material waste reduction: 15–20%

- Rework cost reduction: 40–60%

- **Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)** increase: 15–25%
