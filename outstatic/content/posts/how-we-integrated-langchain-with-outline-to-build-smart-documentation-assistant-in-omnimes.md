**Introduction**

In the world of industrial IT, where technical documentation grows faster than peak-season production, finding specific information becomes a challenge. That’s why we decided to combine two powerful tools: **LangChain** and **Outline**, creating a smart documentation assistant that understands user queries and responds based on the current knowledge base.

In this article, we’ll walk you through **step by step** how we implemented this in our **OmniMES** system. You can see the result in action here:

## Tools We Connected

### **Outline**

An open-source documentation platform. It’s intuitive, supports Markdown, versioning, access control, and webhooks. In our case, it serves as the **source of knowledge** that our chatbot refers to.

### **LangChain**

A framework for building applications using large language models (LLMs). It enables integration with vector databases, LLM APIs, and various data sources to build **question-answering systems, AI agents, or documentation assistants**.

---

## What We Built

We created a smart technical documentation assistant that:

- Indexes documentation from Outline into a FAISS vector database  
- Automatically syncs documentation through webhooks  
- Lets users ask natural language questions and receive answers from relevant document snippets

See a real-world example here:  
[https://cloud.omnimes.com/askme](https://cloud.omnimes.com/askme)  
It’s powered by documentation like this one:  
[OmniMES Documentation](https://docs.omnimes.com/s/1c357062-fcc1-4fbe-a88e-09285cda6e02/doc/profil-mCVVX6AbzS)

## System Architecture

1. **Data Source** – Outline stores documentation in PostgreSQL  
2. **Webhook Trigger** – Any change in a document triggers a webhook at `/webhook/outline/documents`  
3. **LangChain Pipeline** – The webhook processes content, splits it into chunks, and updates the FAISS vector database  
4. **Frontend Interface** – Our Vue (PrimeVue) frontend sends questions to a FastAPI + LangChain backend, which:
   - Finds the most relevant documents using vector similarity
   - Passes them as context to GPT (e.g. GPT-4o)
   - Returns answers based on real documentation

---

## Example Scenario

**User Question:** *“What data is required when launching a production order?”*  
**AI Answer:**  
“According to the *OmniMES system profile* document, the required data includes: order number, product, target quantity, operator, and production line assignment.”

All that without digging through 100 pages of documentation.

---

## What We Gained

- Instant access to essential knowledge  
- Natural interaction with technical content  
- Real-time knowledge updates without system restarts  
- Significantly reduced load on the support team

---

## Who Is It For?

This solution is ideal for companies that:

- Maintain large, structured technical documentation  
- Want to improve knowledge accessibility for employees and clients  
- Seek a real-world application of AI in daily operations

---

## Summary

The combination of Outline and LangChain offers **real, measurable value**. This isn’t just a futuristic toy — it’s a tool that is already **transforming how we interact with documentation**.
