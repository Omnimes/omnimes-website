In many manufacturing plants, modern production lines operate alongside machines that are ten, twenty, or even several decades old. Although these machines are often still mechanically and technologically sound, their biggest limitation is the lack of digital communication. As a result, companies implementing modern MES systems face a key question: **can older equipment be effectively integrated into a digital production environment?**

The answer is **yes** — and there are several proven methods to connect them and obtain the data necessary for performance analysis and process optimization.

## Why Connect Older Machines to an MES System?

Legacy machines are often a crucial part of the production fleet, yet their actual performance frequently remains unknown. Data is collected manually, reports are delayed or missing entirely, and operational decisions rely on experience rather than facts.

Integrating these devices with an MES system finally reveals how they truly operate. It becomes possible to monitor real operating time, detect downtime, analyze cycle performance, and calculate OEE indicators. Companies often discover that machines considered “slow” actually run consistently, while the largest losses occur elsewhere — for example in work organization or changeovers.

Connecting older machines is therefore not merely *technology for technology’s sake*. It is a sound business decision that improves efficiency, production planning, and data-driven decision-making.

## Using PLC Programs and the Importance of the EU Data Act

One of the most common integration methods is using data stored in PLC controllers. In many cases, controllers already contain information about machine cycles, states, and alarms — it only needs to be read and forwarded to the MES.

The **EU Data Act** plays an increasingly important role here. This regulation strengthens the user’s right to access data generated by industrial equipment. In practice, it means the user has the right to machine-generated data, and manufacturers are obliged to provide it wherever technologically possible without unjustified product redesign.

If access to the PLC program is technically feasible, the fastest way to obtain data is to connect the machine to MES and begin collecting information without interfering with mechanics or control logic.

## Communication Gateways as a Bridge Between Old Machines and Modern Systems

When direct PLC communication is difficult, physical communication gateways provide an excellent solution. Devices such as the **Weintek CMT-G01x** enable connection between different industrial protocols and safely transfer data to the MES.

The gateway acts as an intermediary between the machine and the supervisory system, translating controller data into a format understandable by the MES. This allows even machines not designed for Industry 4.0 to become full-fledged sources of production data.

## Additional Sensors — When the Machine Does Not Provide Data

Not all devices have controllers capable of data extraction. In such cases, additional sensors are used. Pulse sensors, current sensors, energy meters, position sensors, or product presence detectors can reconstruct machine logic and pass information to the MES.

This approach is especially effective for very old mechanical equipment where interfering with control systems would be too costly or risky. Sensorization provides essential data without modifying the machine itself.

## Manual Data Entry via HMI Panel — A Transitional Solution

Another integration method is installing an HMI panel where operators manually enter production data such as produced quantity, downtime reasons, or quality information. While quick to deploy, this solution carries the risk of human error.

Incomplete entries, delayed reporting, and inconsistent interpretation affect data quality. Therefore manual reporting is typically treated as a transitional step — enabling digitalization before automatic data collection is implemented.

## Business Benefits of Connecting Legacy Machines

The greatest advantage is visibility into real production efficiency. Management gains access to operating time, downtime, and performance data for every machine regardless of age.

This enables better production planning, identification of loss sources, shift efficiency comparisons, and fact-based investment decisions. In many cases, improving work organization and eliminating micro-downtime yields greater benefits than purchasing new machinery.

## OmniMES — Digitalization Without Replacing the Machine Fleet

The **OmniMES** system is designed to integrate both modern and legacy production equipment. By supporting multiple communication methods — from PLC data acquisition, through communication gateways like the Weintek CMT-G01x, to additional sensor integration — factories can gradually digitalize without costly full fleet replacement.

OmniMES transforms data from any machine into actionable business information that improves efficiency, reduces losses, and enhances production planning.
