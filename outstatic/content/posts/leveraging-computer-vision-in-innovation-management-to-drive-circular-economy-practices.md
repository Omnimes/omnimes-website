# Introduction
In the era of Industry 4.0 and 5.0, **computer vision** is becoming a key tool in innovation management, particularly in the context of the **circular economy**. The application of computer vision technology allows for effective monitoring of production processes, contributing to sustainable development and resource optimization.

## What is Computer Vision?
**Computer vision** is a field of computer science that focuses on the automatic processing of images and visual analysis. In an industrial context, this technology enables:
- Object recognition
- Product quality analysis
- Monitoring of production processes

By utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms, computer vision systems can learn from the collected data, allowing for continuous improvement of processes.

## Circular Economy and Its Importance
The **circular economy** is a model of production and consumption that emphasizes maximizing resource use and minimizing waste. Key principles include:
- Reduction
- Reuse
- Recycling

In the context of innovation, companies must adapt their strategies to implement solutions that promote sustainable development.

## How Computer Vision Supports the Circular Economy
### 1. Monitoring and Analyzing Processes
Computer vision allows for real-time monitoring of production processes, enabling:
- Identification of waste
- Optimization of resource use
- Early detection of defects

With this information, companies can make data-driven decisions, enhancing efficiency and reducing waste.

### 2. Process Automation
In conjunction with Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) like **OmniMES**, computer vision can significantly increase the automation of production processes. These systems:
- Integrate data from various sources
- Enable real-time analysis
- Support decision-making based on data analysis

With OmniMES, companies can effectively manage their resources, which is crucial in the context of the circular economy.

### 3. Support in Recycling
Computer vision also plays a vital role in recycling processes. This technology can:
- Identify recyclable materials
- Classify waste
- Monitor the efficiency of recycling processes

With these functions, companies can increase the share of recycled materials in production, aligning with the principles of the circular economy.

## Examples of Computer Vision Applications
### Example 1: Food Industry
In the food industry, computer vision is used to monitor product quality. Systems can quickly detect irregularities, allowing for prompt responses and minimizing waste.

### Example 2: Textile Industry
In the textile industry, this technology can be used to analyze the quality of materials and monitor production processes, helping to reduce waste.

## Economic Benefits
Implementing computer vision in innovation management brings tangible economic benefits. Sample ROI (Return on Investment) calculations may look as follows:
- Implementation cost of the system: 100,000 PLN
- Savings from waste reduction: 30,000 PLN annually
- Savings from process optimization: 20,000 PLN annually

**ROI** = (Annual Savings / Implementation Cost) * 100% = (50,000 PLN / 100,000 PLN) * 100% = 50%

This demonstrates that investment in computer vision can pay off within two years, making it a cost-effective solution.

## Conclusion
Computer vision is a key tool in innovation management that supports circular economy practices. Through process automation and data analysis capabilities, companies can effectively manage their resources and minimize waste. Collaboration with systems like **OmniMES** further enhances operational efficiency.
