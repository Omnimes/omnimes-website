[Eldrew](https://eldrewpalety.pl) is a company specializing in the production and sale of wooden pallets, operating on the market for many years and supplying its products to customers across Europe. The offer includes standard pallets as well as solutions tailored to the individual needs of clients.

In 2023, we implemented the OmniMES system at Eldrew, covering selected production processes related to pallet manufacturing. The project enabled the integration of the system with the machines used in the production process and the customization of OmniMES functionalities to the specific requirements of the wooden packaging industry.

This implementation is an example of the system’s flexible adaptation to the needs of manufacturing companies, regardless of their scale or type of process.
